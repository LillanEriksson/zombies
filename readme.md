Thoughts before I started:

10 rounds of the whole process

Create 100 green div's, array+map? or a while-loop to create the divs?

Choose a random div to start with and make it red (zombieinfected) = 2 zombies. Use Math.random to choose div.

2 zombies goes to 2 other random houses = 4 zombies ...4, 8, 16 zombie-infected houses, and so on...

Conditionals = if house is already infected, don't push to the infected-array, if not infected -> push

setTimeout to make the iterations visible

How many rounds does it take to make all houses(divs) red?

Show the average amount of rounds it took for the zombies to take over!
# zombies
